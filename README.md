# Calender Project

Welcome to the **Calender Project**!  
This is my very first project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I created this application as a personal learning experience to build a complete full-stack web app, handling both the frontend and backend—from UI to database integration.

## 🚀 Project Motivation

- **Learning Next.js:** My main goal was to get hands-on experience with Next.js, understanding both its frontend and server-side capabilities.
- **Full-Stack Experience:** I wanted to learn how to integrate a backend database and user authentication within a modern React framework.
- **Experimentation:** This project served as a playground for testing out new technologies and best practices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database & Auth:** [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (integration currently paused)
- **Styling:** CSS Modules (can be swapped for Tailwind or other solutions)
- **Hosting:** (Add here if you deployed, e.g., Vercel or Netlify)

## ⏸️ Project Status

**This project is currently on pause** due to some limitations and issues I encountered with Supabase integration. I plan to revisit and continue development once I find a more suitable backend solution or when Supabase addresses the challenges I faced.

## ✨ Features (Planned & Implemented)

- [x] Next.js app structure
- [x] Page routing and navigation
- [x] Calendar UI (basic)
- [x] User authentication

## 📚 What I Learned

- Setting up a Next.js project from scratch
- Working with React components and hooks
- Structuring a full-stack web application
- Initial steps in integrating authentication and a backend database

## 💡 What's Next?

- Resume development once backend issues are resolved
- Polish the UI and add more calendar features
- Explore deploying the app publicly
